Integrated IM IT Policy Framework 

The Digital Framework drives a coordinated, intentional approach to support all public service employees as we transition into a digital government that meets the internet-era needs and expectations of British Columbians. A key action outlined in the Digital Framework is to “create a new digital and data policy framework to guide the work of public servants.” 

As we continue to design an agile approach to address emerging policy issues across OCIO, the first key priority is an Integrated IM IT Policy Framework.  The policy development has been identified as one of the key actions in the Digital Framework. 

Applying agile, design-based principles to the development of this framework will help ensure that IM IT policy meets the needs of end users. We are committed to employing collaborative, people-centred design practices that reflect a broad range of input. That input is crucial to shaping the framework and policy products.

The development of a new policy framework that will enable optimized use of government IM IT assets and enhanced services to citizens. This starts with a modern and effective Core Policy on IM IT. The Integrated IM IT Policy Framework will also enable streamlined future development of other corporate policy instruments, and iteration in response to emerging needs and priorities.

An executive-level Reference Group with representatives from across government is guiding this work but input from a wide array of stakeholders is critical to our success. We’re conducting lots of face-to-face interviews and hosting focus group sessions and workshops to learn more about on-the-ground challenges and opportunities related to IM IT policy. We’ll also be posting frequently on @Work to provide updates and gather insights and information from you, our end users.
